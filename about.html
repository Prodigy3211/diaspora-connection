    <p>
       My name is Fabienne Pamyre Antoine-Nasser and as many can tell by just my name, I have a different cultural background than the average 30 something living in America.
       It was near impossible for me to hide my diaspora identity, even when I wanted to be just like everyone else. My parents came to the United States from Haiti in the 1980s,
       both seeking more opportunities for themselves and their families. Despite leaving their home behind, they managed to maintain ties with their country or culture.
       No matter where we settled, my childhood was always an extension of Haitian living, with smells of meat seasoned with epis filling the hallways, Haitian artwork on each wall,
       Zin blasting from our stereo.

        However, anytime I stepped outside of my childhood home in North Carolina during the 90s and early 2000s, I was faced with the harsh reality of being different from my peers.
        Back then, I often wondered if other members of my diaspora felt isolated like me. When things would happen to Haitians, abroad or in the United States, I didnâ€™t know what to
        do to make a major impact and help more people. When the earthquake struck Haiti in 2010, my family did what we could to help our relatives that needed assistance, but we wished
        we could do something to help more people. In 2022, when images of Haitians being whipped at the US border were circulating in the media, I tried my best to see how I could leverage
        some of the resources of my current job to do something more impactful. My efforts were in vain.   
    </p>
    <p>
        So I founded Diaspora Connection, and dedicated my time to eliminating that feeling of isolation that young Fabienne had growing up and giving members of any diaspora community a space
        where they can organize efforts or just volunteer some of their time. We know that in order to create systemic change, coalitions are necessary. The saying there is power in numbers
        still holds true. Whether diaspora communities want to enact change domestically or back in their homelands, connect, or collaborate- Diaspora Connection will help make that happen.
