        <h1>Mission Statement goes here.</h1>
        <blockquote>
            Create transformational power and movements by organizing prominent diaspora organizations and members on a dynamic online platform.
        </blockquote>
    <h1>Strategic Plan</h1> 
        <ol>
            <li>Start creating an online space (website) for diasporas- taking into account the costs of servers to make sure the site has the capability to house the various organizing needs</li>
            <li>Start doing outreach to prominent members of the diaspora and diaspora organizations to see if they would be willing to join a Diaspora Connection coalition.</li>
            <li>Once the coalition is formed then <a href="https://www.aspencommunitysolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Healing-Centered-Paper.pdf">Healing Centered Organizing</a> can begin (as diaspora communities require the healing component). The coalition will agree on an initial 
                goal/outcome for their campaign (this does not mean that they cannot do other goals in the future) and execute strategies to achieve their goals.</li> 
            <li>Will repeat steps one through three with the current diaspora group for additional campaigns and other diasporas that join the platform.</li>
            <li>We will also use social media ambassadors online to promote the platform to get individuals to join.</li>
        </ol>
